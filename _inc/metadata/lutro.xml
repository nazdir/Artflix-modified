    <systemDescription>Lutro is a 2D game framework that aims for simplicity and extreme portability. Using lutro, you can develop any kind of 2D retro games, like NES or Genesis games, and run them on a wide range of platforms through RetroArch. Lutro makes it easy to write games by using Lua and following the LÃ–VE API. Portability is achieved through the libretro API: Lutro is just loaded as a plugin in a frontend like RetroArch which takes care of display, audio and inputs.</systemDescription>
