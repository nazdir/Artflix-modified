    <systemDescription>While arcade boards have traditionally been custom designs, there have been a number of systems that were instead based on home console platforms. The first such board was the Nintendo VS. System, based on the Famicom and released in 1984. The last console-based board was Namco System 369 which was released in 2011 and based on the Sony PlayStation 3.</systemDescription>
